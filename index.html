        <p>This may come as a bit of a shock to some of my readers but I am not a professional researcher. If I am being completely honest, which is actually a lifetime goal of mine to avoid ever being, I might even say that a big chunk of my research for
            this site is quick wiki scanning mixed with a fair bit of complete bullshit. So when it came to my next lake, Jock Mock Lake, I assumed it would just be a silly name without much history to it. Boy, was I wrong! This lake introduced me to
            some of the most fascinating research material I have ever come across for a blog post! I would link to my sources but what is the fun in that?</p>
        <p>Jock Mock was actually the nickname of Gust Hagberg, a Swedish immigrant from Jokkmokk Sweden. He settled in the Arrowhead region of Minnesota and became the namesake for many lakes and rivers in the area. If you decide to look him up you will
            note that half of the god damn internet says that and pretty much only that about him. I guess this site will join the crowd. But should you persist, you may also find that he was known as the local hermit though he had a quite substantial
            cabin that sadly burned down after the 1940s.</p>
        <p>Since the area was filled with lumberjacks back then, Jock Mock helped keep them hydrated both on the job and afterwards which is why, I guess, they rewarded him with naming bodies of water after him. Now my area (Minneapolis) is filled with lumberjacks,
            or rather “lumbersexuals” which are really just city yuppies with beards, beanies, and $170 flannels from Askov Finlayson.</p>
        <p>Jock Mock’s cabin has long since burned down but I found a story from ’55 where the author visited the spot and the chimney and small stone burial mound for his dog was at the site. I don’t really know if those remain to this day but that area
            of Minnesota has many ghost towns listed of other ruins from the Alger Line railroad and old timey mining days.</p>
        <p>I chose this lake in hopes of making fun of those with better athletic ability than myself but instead found myself slipping down the internet’s midwestern ghost towns tubes. Hell, I don’t think I read anything at all about Jock Mock Lake itself
            but I can only assume it is wet and has a few fish in it.</p>
